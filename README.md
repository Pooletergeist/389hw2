Charlie's starter code, plus a filewrite addendum, is update\_locations.py

python\_benchmarks.csv is the data for (a)

update\_locations.cc is the C port of charlie's starter. c\_benchmark.csv is the data from running it.

typeC\_benchmark.csv is the data for (c).
All the files with syntax <type>\_update\_locations.cc are for (c) using the C port with the numeric type <type>

there's also a makefile.

Hope you're having fun grading!
